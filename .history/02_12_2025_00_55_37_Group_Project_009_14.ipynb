    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, we are working with a real dataset from a UBC Computer Science research group led by Frank Wood. The group is studying how people play video games by running their own Minecraft server, where the players in-game actions are automatically recorded as they move around and interact with the world. Since this is an ongoing research project, the team needs help figuring out how to target the right kinds of players that will give them lots of data, and how to allocate enough resources (server hardware and software licenses) with the goal of supporting their research. To guide their decisions in this, they outlined three broad questions related to predicting player behaviour, player types, and server usage patterns. The chosen question will then be used to formulate a more specific question that can be answered within the scope of this project and course (DSCI 100).\n",
    "\n",
    "Our group decided to focus on the first broad question: What player characteristics and behaviours are most predictive of subscribing to a game-related newsletter, and how do these features differ between various player types? Then, we specified it into one clear research question for the project:\n",
    "\n",
    "“Can a player’s age, their total hours played, experience level, and gender be used to accurately predict their subscription status to the game-related newsletter?”\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer this, we used the \"players.csv\" dataset provided by the research group. It includes player demographics (such as gender and age), gameplay behaviours (like experience level and total hours played), and whether or not each player subscribed to the newsletter. With these variables, we can explore patterns across different kinds of players and build a model that predicts subscription status based on gameplay and demographic features. It will be useful to the research group to allow them to better understand what drives player engagement and how to target their future recruitment efforts."
